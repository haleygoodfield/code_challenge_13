# My Thirteenth Coding Challenge
Hello again! This is my thirteenth coding challenge using JavaScript. Here, I will apply my skills in DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove employee cards by creating an interactive dashboard for managing employees in a company.
My project is split into 5 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating the Base Structure
+ Task 2: Adding Employee Cards Dynamically
+ Task 3: Converting NodeLists to Arrays for Bulk Updates
+ Task 4: Implementing Removal of Employee Cards with Event Bubbling
+ Task 5: Additional Challenge â€“ Inline Editing of Employee Details
I hope that you enjoy my attempt on the challenge!
