# My Thirteenth Coding Challenge
This is my thirteenth coding challenge using JavaScript. Here, I will apply my skills in DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove employee cards to create a **Employee Management System Dashboard**.
This scenario is split into 5 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating the Base Structure
+ Task 2: Adding Employee Cards Dynamically
+ Task 3: Converting NodeLists to Arrays for Bulk Updates
+ Task 4: Implementing Removal of Employee Cards with Event Bubbling
+ Task 5: Inline Editing of Employee Details
